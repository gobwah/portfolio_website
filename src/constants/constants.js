      'The collaborative project CLOChèTE aims to propose and evaluate innovative solutions based on connected objects to help the management of herds and the enhancement of pastoral areas. I took part of this project for my master thesis. I defined the functionnal aspects of this tool and compare two inertial devices for behaviour recognition with a statistical aproach.',
